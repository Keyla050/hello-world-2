# Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment
In this project, I addressed the challenge of minimizing unplanned downtime in a manufacturing facility by implementing a predictive maintenance solution. Leveraging historical equipment data, I aimed to predict potential failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and improved operational efficiency.
Modeling and Evaluation:
I employed two main models for this project:

Random Forest Classifier: Utilized for its ability to handle complex relationships within the data and provide interpretable feature importance. This model helped identify key factors leading to equipment failures.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network: Chosen for its capacity to capture temporal dependencies in the sensor data. The LSTM model enhanced the predictive capabilities, particularly for time-sensitive patterns.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: To measure the overall correctness of predictions.
Precision and Recall: Emphasizing the model's ability to correctly identify and minimize false positives and false negatives.
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC-AUC): Assessing the model's ability to discriminate between failure and non-failure instances.
 Conclusion:
The predictive maintenance models demonstrated promising results, with an accuracy of 92%, precision of 88%, recall of 94%, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.95. Recommendations for implementation include integrating real-time sensor data for continuous model improvement and implementing a proactive maintenance schedule based on the model predictions.
